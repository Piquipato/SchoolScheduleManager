# SchoolScheduleManager
This project is a way to help teachers at schools make their own schedules, and help them to organise in a fast, clean way. No more waiting for two weeks to have a schedule!

/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

Programming Language:
- Python 3.6 --> __main__ ;)
- Kivy Modules --> For GUIs
- SQLite --> To Store data which the user inputs.

Versions:
x.y.z --> x = main version; y = recent update; z = casual patch;

1.0.0 Features:
- Automatised Schedules based on inputs.
- SQLite Databases to store inputs and use them later.
- User Interface to help people not familiarized with programming.

About Me (@piquipato):
I'm not an experienced programmer. My idea is to create a tool for my teachers to use in the School. This way, everything goes faster. Other reason why I'm creating this repository is to sell this tool for the Schools in my area which would be interested.
